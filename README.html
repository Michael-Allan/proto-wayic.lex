<h1 lang='en-CA'>wayic.lex - Dictionary of wayic terms</h1>
<p lang='en-CA' id='web_serving'>
    When serving this project on the Web, or other projects that use it to define terms,
    you will want to serve the term documents with appropriate response headers.
    (The term documents are those which are stored in files without a filename extension.)
    Appropriate response headers are:
    </p>
<ul lang='en-CA'>
    <li><code>
        <a href='https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17'>
        Content type</a>: application/xhtml+xml
        </code></li>
    <li><code>
        <a href='https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-origin'>
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: *
        </code></li>
    </ul>
<p lang='en-CA'>
    The purpose of allowing universal access (<code>*</code>) is that term documents located elsewhere
    (including those located by ‘file’ scheme URLs) may require access in order to resolve
    their <a href='http://reluk.ca/project/wayic/lex/_/doc.task'>content importers</a>.
